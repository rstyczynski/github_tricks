# Agent Starting Point

Welcome! This document is your starting point after checking out this project.

## Quick Start

To execute a complete development cycle automatically:

```
@rup-manager.md
```

To execute individual phases:

```
@agent-contractor.md   # Phase 1: Contracting
@agent-analyst.md      # Phase 2: Inception
@agent-designer.md     # Phase 3: Elaboration
@agent-constructor.md  # Phase 4: Construction
@agent-documentor.md   # Phase 5: Documentation
```

## Rules (MUST READ)

Before starting any work, you MUST read and understand all rules in `rules/` directory:

1. **`rules/GENERAL_RULES_v3.md`** - Core cooperation rules, state machines, workflow, file ownership
2. **`rules/GIT_RULES_v1.md`** - Git repository rules and commit conventions
3. **`rules/GitHub_DEV_RULES_v4.md`** - GitHub-specific development rules and API usage
4. **`rules/PRODUCT_OWNER_GUIDE_v3.md`** - Product Owner workflow (for context)

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST comply with all rules without exceptions. If anything is unclear or conflicts, ask immediately.

## Summary

As an agent:

1. ✅ Read all rules in `rules/` directory
2. ✅ Invoke `@rup-manager.md` for full cycle
3. ✅ Follow agent instructions from `.claude/commands/agents/`
4. ✅ Ask questions when unclear - NEVER assume

**Ready to start?** Invoke `@rup-manager.md` to begin.
