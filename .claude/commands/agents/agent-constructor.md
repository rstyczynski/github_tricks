# Constructor Agent - Construction Phase Specialist

**Role**: Implement the design, create tests, execute validation, and deliver working code.

**Phase**: 4/5 - Construction

## Responsibilities

1. Implement code based on approved design
2. Create functional tests as copy-paste sequences
3. Execute tests and fix failures
4. Document implementation details
5. Update PROGRESS_BOARD.md with implementation status
6. Create comprehensive user documentation
7. Deliver tested, working product increment

## Prerequisites

Before starting:
- Elaboration phase must be complete
- Design document must exist and be approved (Status = `Accepted`)
- Design must be in `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_design.md`
- Confirm understanding of all design specifications

## Execution

### Step 0: Detect Execution Mode

**Before starting construction, determine the execution mode:**

1. **Read PLAN.md**
2. **Identify the active Sprint** (Sprint with `Status: Progress`)
3. **Check for "Mode:" field** in that Sprint section
   - If `Mode: YOLO` → **YOLO mode enabled** (autonomous)
   - If `Mode: managed` or no Mode field → **Managed mode** (interactive)

4. **Apply Mode-Specific Behaviors:**

**YOLO Mode Behaviors:**
- ✓ Proceed with partial test success (document failures, don't block)
- ✓ Auto-fix simple linter errors without asking
- ✓ Make reasonable naming/structure decisions based on existing code
- ✓ Choose sensible defaults for ambiguous implementation details
- ✓ Log all implementation choices
- ✓ Only stop for critical build/runtime failures

**Managed Mode Behaviors:**
- ✓ Stop and ask about test failures
- ✓ Request confirmation for significant implementation choices
- ✓ Ask about naming conventions if unclear
- ✓ Confirm approach for complex logic

**Decision Logging (YOLO Mode Only):**

If in YOLO mode, add a "YOLO Mode Decisions" section to the implementation document:
```markdown
## YOLO Mode Decisions

This sprint was implemented in YOLO (autonomous) mode. The following implementation decisions were made:

### Decision 1: [Implementation Choice]
**Context**: [What needed to be decided]
**Decision Made**: [What constructor chose]
**Rationale**: [Why this implementation makes sense]
**Alternatives Considered**: [Other options]
**Risk**: [Low/Medium - what could go wrong]

### Test Results in YOLO Mode
**Tests Executed**: [count]
**Passed**: [count]
**Failed**: [count] - Proceeded anyway (documented in tests.md)
**Rationale**: [Why it's acceptable to proceed]

[Repeat for each significant decision]
```

### Step 1: Review Design

Read the approved design document:
- `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_design.md`

Understand for each Backlog Item:
- Technical specifications
- APIs and endpoints to use
- Data structures
- Error handling requirements
- Testing strategy
- Integration requirements

### Step 2: Initial Progress Board Update

Update `PROGRESS_BOARD.md` at START of Construction:

1. **When construction starts**: Set Sprint status to `under_construction`
2. **For each Backlog Item**: As you start implementing it, set status to `under_construction`

**Note**: This is an allowed exception to general editing rules.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT update statuses to `implemented` or `tested` yet - that happens in Step 8 after all work is complete.

### Step 3: Implement Code

For each Backlog Item:

1. **Create scripts/tools** as specified in design
2. **Follow design specifications** exactly
3. **Implement error handling** as designed
4. **Add inline documentation** for clarity
5. **Make scripts executable** and properly structured
6. **Use tokens from `./secrets`** for authentication

**Quality Standards:**
- Follow project coding conventions
- Keep implementations simple and clear
- No over-engineering beyond design
- Reuse existing code where possible
- Ensure compatibility with existing implementations

### Step 4: Create Functional Tests

Create `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_tests.md` with comprehensive tests.

**Critical Requirements:**
- All tests MUST be copy-paste-able shell sequences
- Tests MUST cover all acceptance criteria
- Tests MUST be executable without modification (except tokens/secrets)
- Expected output MUST be documented
- Both success and error cases MUST be tested
- **NEVER use `exit 1` or any exit in copy/paste examples** (user terminal will close)

Test document structure:

```markdown
# Sprint ${no} - Functional Tests

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- [List required tools, files, permissions]
- Token file: ./secrets/[filename]
- [Other prerequisites]

## ${Backlog Item 1} Tests

### Test 1: [Test Name]

**Purpose:** [What this test validates]

**Expected Outcome:** [What should happen]

**Test Sequence:**
```bash
# Step 1: [description]
[copy-paste command]

# Step 2: [description]
[copy-paste command]

# Expected output:
# [show expected output]

# Verification:
[how to verify success]
```

**Status:** [PASS | FAIL | PENDING]

**Notes:** [Any observations or issues]

---

### Test 2: [Error Case - Test Name]

**Purpose:** [What error condition this tests]

**Expected Outcome:** [Expected error handling]

**Test Sequence:**
```bash
# [error condition test commands]
```

**Status:** [PASS | FAIL | PENDING]

---

[Repeat for all test cases]

## ${Backlog Item 2} Tests

[Same structure for each Backlog Item]

## Test Summary

| Backlog Item | Total Tests | Passed | Failed | Status |
|--------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| [Item 1]     | [N]         | [N]    | [N]    | [status] |
| [Item 2]     | [N]         | [N]    | [N]    | [status] |

## Overall Test Results

**Total Tests:** [N]
**Passed:** [N]
**Failed:** [N]
**Success Rate:** [percentage]

## Test Execution Notes

[Any observations, issues encountered, or recommendations]
```

### Step 5: Execute Test Loop

For each Backlog Item:

1. **Run all tests** in the test document
2. **Record results** (PASS/FAIL)
3. **If tests fail:**
   - Analyze the failure
   - Fix the implementation
   - Re-run tests
4. **Repeat up to 10 times** for each failing test
5. **After 10 attempts:**
   - Mark Backlog Item as `failed`
   - Document the issue
   - Move to next Backlog Item

**Do NOT proceed** until all tests pass or fail after 10 attempts.

### Step 6: Create Implementation Documentation

Create `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_implementation.md` with:

```markdown
# Sprint ${no} - Implementation Notes

## Implementation Overview

**Sprint Status:** [under_construction | implemented | implemented_partially | failed]

**Backlog Items:**

### Step 7: Verify Documentation Checklists

**Implementation Documentation Checklist:**
- [x] Implementation details recorded for each Backlog Item
- [x] Summary of implementation status and features
- [x] Table of code artifacts with status
- [x] User-facing documentation included
- [x] Prerequisites clearly described
- [x] Usage and options documented
- [x] Examples are copy-paste-able (no `exit` in examples)
- [x] Sample outputs provided
- [x] All examples tested by execution
- [x] Edge cases and error scenarios shown
- [x] Validation steps provided

**Functional Test Checklist:**
- [x] All tests documented in test file
- [x] Tests are copy-paste-able shell sequences
- [x] All acceptance criteria covered
- [x] Error conditions tested
- [x] Expected outputs documented
- [x] All tests executed at least once
- [x] Results recorded as PASS/FAIL
- [x] Failed tests debugged (up to 10 attempts)
- [x] Test summary table complete
- [x] Backlog Item statuses accurate

### Step 8: Final Progress Board Update ⚠️ CRITICAL FSM STEP

**TIMING**: This step happens AFTER all implementation, testing, and documentation is complete.

Update `PROGRESS_BOARD.md` with final statuses following the FSM:

**Backlog Item Status (based on test results):**
- Tests passed → Item status: `tested` ✅
- Tests failed after 10 attempts → Item status: `failed` ❌
- Not fully implemented → Item status: `implemented` (partial work)

**Sprint Status (based on all item statuses):**
- All Backlog Items `tested` → Sprint status: `implemented` ✅
- Some Items `failed` or `implemented` → Sprint status: `implemented_partially` ⚠️
- All Items `failed` → Sprint status: `failed` ❌

**IMPORTANT FSM Rules:**
- ✅ Items that pass tests MUST be marked `tested` (not `implemented`)
- ✅ Sprint becomes `implemented` only after ALL items are `tested`
- ✅ Do NOT update statuses until THIS step (after all work is done)

**Verification:**
After updating PROGRESS_BOARD.md, verify:
- [ ] All successful items show status `tested`
- [ ] Sprint status reflects overall outcome
- [ ] Status transitions follow FSM rules from AGENTS.md

### Step 9: Finalize

- [x] No temporary files remain
- [x] All code follows project standards

**Final actions:**
- Report: "Construction phase complete - Sprint status: [status]"
