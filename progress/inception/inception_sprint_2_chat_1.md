# Inception Review – Sprint 2

- Confirmed SRS shows Sprint 2 in `Progress`, focused on backlog item GH-4 (“Workflow log access realtime access”) requiring real-time visibility into active workflow logs.
- Prior Sprints (0 and 1) are marked `Done`; tooling and correlation foundations already implemented.
- Expectation: design next iteration around streaming in-flight logs—likely via GitHub Actions APIs/CLI (`gh run watch`, job log endpoints) or other mechanisms that expose live output.
