# RSB Sprint 0 - Implementation Notes

## RSB-1. RUP Strikes Back method has own life-cycle tools

Status: Implemented

### Implementation Details

Created the three core lifecycle management files for RUP Strikes Back methodology:

1. **RSB_BACKLOG.md** - Backlog tracking for RUP Strikes Back methodology
   - Created with 6 backlog items (RSB-1 through RSB-6)
   - Properly numbered starting from 1 (not 0)
   - Includes descriptions for each backlog item

2. **RSB_PLAN.md** - Implementation plan organizing RSB backlog items into sprints
   - Created with 4 sprints (RSB Sprint 0-3)
   - All sprints use proper status values from the state machine (Planned, Progress)
   - Follows same structure as PLAN.md

3. **RSB_PROGRESS_BOARD.md** - Progress tracking board
   - Created with table format matching PROGRESS_BOARD.md structure
   - Tracks sprint status and individual backlog item status
   - Currently tracking RSB Sprint 0 as "progress" with RSB-1 as "implemented"

### Files Created

- `/Users/rstyczynski/projects/github_tricks/RSB_BACKLOG.md`
- `/Users/rstyczynski/projects/github_tricks/RSB_PLAN.md`
- `/Users/rstyczynski/projects/github_tricks/RSB_PROGRESS_BOARD.md`
- `/Users/rstyczynski/projects/github_tricks/progress/rsb_sprint_0_implementation.md`

### Notes

The RUP Strikes Back methodology now has its own complete lifecycle management system, separate from the GitHub Tricks project it's being developed on. This enables independent tracking and evolution of the methodology itself.
