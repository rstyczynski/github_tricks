# Construction – Sprint 7

## Discussion Summary

- Implementation attempts completed for GH-11 with tooling ready to register a webhook and process payloads, but validation requires live GitHub/webhook.site access that is unavailable in the current environment.
- Without the ability to execute the end-to-end webhook test loop, we cannot demonstrate that GitHub webhooks provide the run_id as required, so Sprint 7 is considered failed for now.

## Outcome

- Sprint 7 marked as Failed. Await further instructions before revisiting the webhook approach.
