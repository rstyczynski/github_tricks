# Elaboration – Sprint 9 (Chat 1)

## Discussion Summary

- Reviewed cooperation rules (`rules/GENERAL_RULES_v3.md`, `rules/GIT_RULES_v1.md`, `rules/GitHub_DEV_RULES_v4.md`, `rules/PRODUCT_OWNER_GUIDE_v3.md`) and confirmed full compliance.
- Re-read SRS scope for Sprint 9: implement GH-12 using direct GitHub REST API calls (`curl`) with token authentication from `./secrets`.
- Examined `progress/sprint_9_design.md`; design is already in `Status: Accepted` and requires implementing `scripts/view-run-jobs-curl.sh` per documented interface, parity with Sprint 8 script, and reuse of shared utilities.
- No open questions or design blockers identified.

## Design Completion Confirmation

Design for Sprint 9 (GH-12 curl implementation) stands accepted and ready for construction.
