# Contracting Review

- Reviewed `rules/GENERAL_RULES.md` and `rules/GitHub_DEV_RULES.md`; confirmed ownership boundaries, design workflow, and prohibition on editing statuses or product-owner chapters.
- Read `SRS.md` to capture backlog scope and sprint assignments; noted Sprint 0 and Sprint 1 both in `Progress`.
- Clarified Sprint 1 backlog items after user prompt and reconfirmed responsibilities before proceeding.
- Re-read the rule documents, including `rules/generic/GIT_RULES.md`, when requested to reconfirm obligations before amending this summary and commit.
