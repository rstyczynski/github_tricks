# Elaboration Review

- Confirmed rule set (`rules/GENERAL_RULES.md`, `rules/GitHub_DEV_RULES.md`, `rules/generic/GIT_RULES.md`) and summarized Sprint 0/1 requirements from `SRS.md`.
- Authored initial Sprint 0 and Sprint 1 design drafts, then updated them after feedback to include backlog descriptions, goals, and corrected identifiers (`GH-1`, `GH-2`, `GH-3`).
- Adjusted Sprint 1 design so `GH-2` handles webhook triggering without correlation logic, while `GH-3` covers correlation strategy via helper tooling.
- Documented contracting and inception reviews, plus noted requirement to maintain semantic commit messages.
