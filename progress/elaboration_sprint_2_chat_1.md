# Elaboration Review – Sprint 2

- Confirmed Sprint 2 is in `Progress` with backlog item GH-4 (“Workflow log access realtime access”).
- Authored `sprint_2_design.md` detailing `scripts/stream-run-logs.sh` for streaming in-flight GitHub Actions logs via `gh api`, including incremental gzip tailing, summary mode, and integration with existing correlation tooling.
- No open questions; implementation will focus on the log-stream helper, documentation, and usage guidance.
