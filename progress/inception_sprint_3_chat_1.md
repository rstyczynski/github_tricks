# Inception Review – Sprint 3

- Confirmed adherence to cooperation, git, and development rules; no ambiguities identified.
- Reviewed SRS and prior sprint artifacts: Sprint 0 prerequisites guide, Sprint 1 dispatch/correlation tooling, Sprint 2 long-run logger plus post-run log limitations.
- Identified Sprint 3 (status `Progress`) scope: backlog item GH-5 focusing on reliable log retrieval after workflow completion using stored run metadata.
- Recognized need to extend existing scripts/documentation so operators can fetch completed-run logs while reusing correlation artifacts.
- Ready to draft Sprint 3 design detailing GH-5 approach and validation strategy.
